### About

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is used to check whether a time series is stationary, which is a necessary condition before applying an ARIMA model. It helps determine if the data needs to be differenced and supports the correct selection of the autoregressive order. In the explained case, the results showed that an AR(1) model, which uses only one lag, was already statistically significant and sufficient for forecasting, meaning the model does not need many past values to predict future behavior accurately.
